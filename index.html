    <h2>
      Hi, I'm Mei Rose, an independent scholar of Formal Logic, a web developer,
      and a cat lover who owns no cats.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I studied Mathematics and Linguistics in my undergraduate degree program
      at Stony Brook University, and have now shifted my focus towards finding
      ways of sharing the joy of Mathematics and Formal Logic with students of
      all ages through interactive software applications. I like to find the
      intersections between my interests and the creative arts, and yes, it's
      true, I love cats but own none.

            <h4>Magic 15 Python Game</h4>
          <p>
            This game, isomorphic to tic-tac-toe or Noughts and Crosses, asks two players
            to take turns choosing numbers between 1 and 9 inclusive with a goal of selecting
            numbers that sum to 15 before the other player does. It was written in Python
            and runs on the CMU_Graphics package, which itself is built on the pygame package. 
            Features to be developed include a recusive algorithm for checking whether a win is possible
            at all after each player takes their turn, and an improved UI.

            <h4>Kalish-Montague-Mar Natural Deduction LaTeX Formatter</h4>
          <p>
            An idea that I've been working on for a while, this code takes a KMM
            natural deduction given in a plaintext format and turns it into the appropriate
            boxed-and-cancelled natural deduction one expects from the KMM style, just
            in a format that is readable into a LaTeX document. So far, it is undecided
            whether it will do this via TikZ or by producing a vector graphics file. The hard
            part of this project has been standardizing the plaintext representations of deductions.

            <h4>Admintopia</h4>
          <p>
            Admintopia is a satirical incrememtal clicker game themed around the 
            seemingly-endless number of administrative staff hired at modern American
            univeristies. The user can click to admit undergraduate students, whose
            tuition goes solely to paying the salaries of increasingly higher-ranked
            administrators. Undergraduate student tuition can also pay for Masters students,
            whose tuition can in turn pay doctoral students. And various numbers of these types of
            students are required for the "privilege" of hiring higher-ranked admins.

            this site is a project as well! It is currently being developed as a part
            of the Carnegie Mellon University Techbridge Bootcamp. Expect more exciting
            features soon, like photos and screenshots for projects, elaborate CSS styling,
            a contact form, and more. There might even be some Easter Eggs added for those who
            wish to look for them...
