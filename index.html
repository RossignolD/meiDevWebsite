    <h2>
      Hi, I'm Mei Rose, an independent scholar of Formal Logic, a web developer,
      and a cat lover who owns no cats.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I studied Mathematics and Linguistics in my undergraduate degree program
      at Stony Brook University, and have now shifted my focus towards finding
      ways of sharing the joy of Mathematics and Formal Logic with students of
      all ages through interactive software applications. I like to find the
      intersections between my interests and the creative arts, and yes, it's
      true, I love cats but own none.

          two players to take turns choosing numbers between 1 and 9 inclusive
          with a goal of selecting numbers that sum to 15 before the other
          player does. It was written in Python and runs on the CMU_Graphics
          package, which itself is built on the pygame package. Features to be
          developed include a recusive algorithm for checking whether a win is
          possible at all after each player takes their turn, and an improved
          UI."

            Compete against another player to select numbers to add to 15 before
            they do! This project really showed me how much we take for granted
            in modern web development...

          data-description="An idea that I've been working on for a while, this code takes a KMM
          natural deduction given in a plaintext format and turns it into the
          appropriate boxed-and-cancelled natural deduction one expects from
          the KMM style, just in a format that is readable into a LaTeX
          document. So far, it is undecided whether it will do this via TikZ
          or by producing a vector graphics file. The hard part of this
          project has been standardizing the plaintext representations of
          deductions."

          <p>
            Ever wanted to see your natural deductions transformed from the way
            that we write them on the board to a nice LaTeX format? I did. So I
            started this project.

        students, whose tuition goes solely to paying the salaries of
        increasingly higher-ranked administrators. Undergraduate student
        tuition can also pay for Masters students, whose tuition can in turn
        pay doctoral students. And various numbers of these types of
        students are required for the 'privilege' of hiring higher-ranked

            This satirical clicker game simulates a world called Admintopia,
            where the only thing that university student tuition can go towards
            is hiring more administrators.

            ≈Åukasiewicz's System 4 under a Hilbert-style deduction system, this
            was the first software product I ever built.

            This project was built in collaboration with Stony Brook University
            Evolution and Ecology professors. Their findings that the
            distribution of hermit crab shell sizes is similar to human income
            inequalities showed up in the New York Times!

            Yes, I really did do this. I received 26 votes in total, nowhere near the number needed to advance
            into the second round of elections, but still consider it an exercise in chasing those wild dreams!
